! colemak-DvbgHm__angle(z)_wide_custom Notes:
!
! If switching to an angle mod for the first time, v doesn't actually move. d,
! h, b, and g end up in better positions. x, c, z, and m (being less frequently
! used) end up in worse positions. When switching to an angle mod for the first
! time, the new x and c positions are still better with the new fingering.


! stevp99's Dvbg/Hm and DreymaR's Dbg/Hk:
! On a standard keyboard, I slightly prefer the Dvbg/Hm DH positions,
! especially since my hands are angled in even with a wide mod. With a keyboard
! that isn't horizontally staggered, I definitely prefer Dvbg/Hm.
