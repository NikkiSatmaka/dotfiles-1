" TODO:
" setl
" site specific ti (i.e. 4chan v gel)
" add clicks to get focus right immediately (i.e. on reddit); or change from despotic?
" restrict g* bindings (no gt or gb or..); add keys to leave alone section

" only remap keys when their functionality is replaced or not necessary for the site

" NOTE:
" passkeys passes any binding that include the letter
" i.e. if pass i with passkeys, gi won't work; using groups with pass fixes this

" NOTE:
" For using custom mappings through pentadactyl (e.g. a site supports mappings, but you can't change them; you can bind a key to send a different keypress to firefox)
" sadly, feedkeys cannot feed directly to firefox (no -m passthrough); it still can be used, but it's pretty useless because sites often won't detect all or any keypresses after sending a key to enter passthrough (have to do something like feedkeys <pass-all-keys>somekeys<esc> or <pass-next-key>j .. and may be slow or not work)
" because you can't feed to firefox, might as well just nmap <key> <pass-next-key><key> (which suffers from the same problems; works for some sites.. sometimes doesn't work at all; when it does work, it's slow)
" fastest way I have found is just to fake the key bindings without using pentadactyl (xdotool or xsendkey); using a hideous combination of both
