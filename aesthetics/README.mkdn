The panels are bar aint recursive (see .config/bspwm/panel). The current one is based on the default bspwm bar and esn89's bar (just panel). The top panel from the old screenshot is panel2.
The conky theme is charley166's lsd theme (I've modified it to create a black version as well).
Fonts used are Inconsolata (and maybe -g or -dz; I don't remember) for the terminal, and uushi and stlarch for the panels.
I'm using feh to set the background.

Not that useful, but it looks nice. The only thing I've done is added an extra column with blue coloring, changed the links, changed the favicon, added a bunch of renders to the `mascots` folder, and added an extra 'i', a hyphen, and an actual ellpsis characterâ€¦

Older:
The tmux statusline was generated with tmuxline and then heavily modified. I've stopped using tmux-powerline and just taken parts of the segments I like (notably the git staged and git modified parts on the left).

I guess you could say I used tmuxline, but I ended up only keeping a few of the colours to match my airline theme. This is what it looked like initially:
