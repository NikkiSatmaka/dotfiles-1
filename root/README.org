* Pre-Install
- Either wipe the root/var partitions or move e.g. =/opt=, =/usr=, =/var=, =/lib= , =/lib64=, and =/etc= to somewhere else as backup (boot is okay to keep though will need to delete old image to be able to install intel-ucode).  I also deleted =bin= and =sbin= symlinks.
- Mount partitions including boot and ESP (see boot README for example)
- Connect to the internet (e.g. with ~iwctl~)
- Dotfiles should be in place (should be able to run the scripts in this directory)
- Run the =./system-install= script to pacstrap and then chroot into the system

* Inside Chroot
- Create your user: ~useradd --create-home <user>~
- Set your user's password: ~password <user>~
- Recommended: ~pacman -Syu~
- Validate then run ~./pacman-keys~
- ~./post-install~

* After Reboot
- ~sudo post-install non-chroot~
- Examine failure log and fix any issues

* Size Issues
If nix is just monstrously large, see nixshrink.
