*Note*

For multiple wm prefix keys, I duplicated the external prefix command and key handler. I still have not found an easy way to use 3+ key bindings (i.e. rmh). The only way I know how to do this from the shell script would involve opening a terminal to read the third key or opening a gui popup, which I don't want to do. I'm not competent enough to change sxiv to allow for this. I tried looping back to sxiv (for example, hit "r".. sends next keypress to the external key handler.. if the next key is "m" it will fake an out of the way key that is bound to a different prefix in the config.h so that the third keypress will then be read by a different shell script) but sxiv doesn't respond to fake keypresses sent with xdotool, xsendkey, etc. in this manner it would seem, which I have not bothered attempting to fix yet.
