# this is a backup solution if I ever happen to have an issue with my main
# kanata setup
# notice how many extra programs/steps are needed when not using kanata for
# everything (klfc/XKB, xmodmap, xcape, hkd)

# * TrackPoint Buttons as Keys
# Old method:
# # using these as thumbkeys (see ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc)
# xinput --set-button-map "TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint" 50 1 51
# xinput --set-button-map "ETPS/2 Elantech TrackPoint" 50 1 51
# xinput --set-button-map "Elan TrackPoint" 50 3 51

# NOTE: I would just remap the scan codes if I could:
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/1145057/remapping-mouse-buttons-to-keyboard-keys

# new method that allows for dual-role
# must happen before or klfc sets up capslock or it can't be used correctly for
# nav layer
xrestart kanata -c ~/.config/kanata/trackpoint.kbd
# wait for kanata startup
sleep 3

# * Klfc
if [[ -n $1 ]]; then
	# regenerate layout
	klfc --from-json ~/dotfiles/remap/.colemak-DH-custom.json \
			--xkb ~/dotfiles/remap/xkb
fi
~/dotfiles/remap/xkb/run-session.sh -m Wide-ja

# * Add Hyper
# needs to be done after klfc's run-session (which will reset mods)
# make hyper a unique modifier for sxhkd (will be left trackpoint button)
# don't need numlock (which is normally mod2)
xmodmap -e "clear mod2"
# make F24 hyper/mod2
xmodmap -e "remove mod4 = Hyper_L"
xmodmap -e "add mod2 = Hyper_L Hyper_L"
xmodmap -e "keycode 202 = Hyper_L"

# * Dual-role
rldxcape

# * Fix Media Keys
# media keys bound on layer don't work with sxhkd; need to use hkd to grab the
# physical positions
xrestart hkd
