# This is a comment
	"As you can see, quotes will be converted to their correctly angled counterparts. Also, Jack told me the following when questioned about his drug habit: 'One level of nesting is supported.' How wonderful," said I.
	Each line corresponds to a paragraph (the start of an indented line). No hard wrapping is used.
	_This is italic text_.
	A caret (^) or plus (+) here will not be parsed as a chapter title. # This is also comment
	\# This is not a comment.
	A literal backslash must be escaped: \\
	Symbols that need to be escaped for LaTeX will be automatically: & % {} ~ ^
	Literal underscores and asterisks must be escaped manually: \_ \*
Indentation at the beginning of the line doesn't matter. Empty lines don't matter either:




	This paragraph is an example of using a placeholder for Dr. ..'s name...
	This script _can also deal with unmatched symbols. This line will just be italicized and emboldened *here to the end.
	This line remains untouched.
